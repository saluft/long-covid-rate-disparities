                    Around <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220622.htm#:~:text=NCHS%20Home-,Nearly%20One%20in%20Five%20American%20Adults%20Who%20Have%20Had,19%20Still%20Have%20%E2%80%9CLong%20COVID%E2%80%9D&text=New%20data%20from%20the%20Household,symptoms%20of%20%E2%80%9Clong%20COVID.%E2%80%9D">16 million</a> U.S. adults are living with long COVID according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, fatigue, brain fog, blood clots, joint pain, and depression, among others. 
			<p>
				An analysis of five months of data from the Household Pulse Survey points to disparities by gender, sexual orientation, and disability status. Women who've had COVID-19 were 1.6 times more likely to report long COVID than men. Transgender and bisexual people reported the highest rates of long COVID compared to adults of other gender identities and sexual orientations. Adults with disabilities reported symptoms at 2.5 times the rate of people without disabilities.

            <p>
                Scientists can't yet say conclusively what's driving disparities in long COVID rates, though experts point to a few possible explanations. “A lot of the risk factors for long COVID overlap with COVID, and they also overlap with socioeconomic disadvantage,” said Denis Nash, an epidemiologist and executive director of CUNY's Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health.

                Differences in male and female immune systems, rates of preexisting conditions, and healthcare access may be at play, said Nash. “This represents a major public health burden and threat,” said Nash.

                The charts below show the average percentages of adults with a prior COVID-19 infection who reported that they were actively living with long COVID between June and October 2022.
